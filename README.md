## Faxinator

This electron based app has been replaced by a new web based solution found [here](https://github.com/Volxz/FaxinatorFrontEnd) 

Faxinator is an Electon based app built with Vuejs and Bulma. This application is designed to allow employees at Exeter Dental Care to easily send faxes by uploading a PDF. This app utilizes Google Cloud Functions and Twilio to send faxes and the contact and configuration data is stored in json files on a local Samba share on the office network.
